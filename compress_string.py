"""Write a function that compresses a string.

Repeated characters should be compressed to one character and the number of
times it repeats. If a character appears once, it should not be followed by a number.
The function should handle letters, whitespace, and punctuation.

>>> compress('aabbaabb')
'a2b2a2b2'
If a character appears once, it should not be followed by a number:
>>> compress('abc')
'abc' 
>>> compress('Hello, world! Cows go moooo...')
'Hel2o, world! Cows go mo4.3'
